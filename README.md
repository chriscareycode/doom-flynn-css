Flynn from Doom as a CSS sprite for your project

![Flynn Animation](flynn-animation.gif?raw=true "Flynn Animation")

I love this Flynn character from Doom. Thanks to the GKrellFlynn plugin, he is on my CPU monitor and gets more and more bloody as the computer CPU usage increases. I thought this would be a fun concept to take to other projects and to the web so I extracted this single XPM image file in the GKrellFlynn source code,
converted it to a transparent png, and wrote some CSS to make him into a CSS sprite.
Feel free to take the code for your own purposes. Have fun and please let me know if you use this somewhere!

26 frames of animation, so you can change that flynn1 up to flynn26

Open index.html and view source code for an example of how to use Flynn.
